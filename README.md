Console card games

### Description
* Some simple card games which you can play on the console
* More games will be added to this project in the coming days

#### The Games
* HiLo : 
	* The aim of the game could not be much simpler. All you need to do is guess whether the next card to be dealt will be higher or lower than the one that is currently on the table.
* wars : 
	* The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards.
	* The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.
	* Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

	* If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
* blackjack : 
	* Follows more or less the classic blackjack/21 rules with a single player, and the computer as the dealer.
	* There are no bets and only a single round.
